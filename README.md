# Polynomial-Decomposition
## Project on polynomial decomposition in a symbolic computation framework

In this folder you will find a project on polynomial decomposition, as well as a Maple file with some practical code.
The paper is much more interesting than the code, as it actually explains what PD is, and why it's useful. The
coding isn't actually all that difficult, and could easily be done in any symbolic computing language.
